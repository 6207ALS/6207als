### Hi there, I'm Allen ðŸ‘‹
<br>
I'm a full-stack engineer with extensive experience in the JavaScript ecosystem. Most recently, I built [Campfire](https://campfire-previews.github.io/) , a self-hosted, CI/CD development framework that deploys dedicated preview environments with integrated collaboration tools on AWS. Check it out below!
